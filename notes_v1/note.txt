}


note id is year,month,day,hour,minute,second


The index is as 1 = row, 2 = column, 0= spacer for next iteration, row and column starts from 1 , assume list contains everything orderly
  e.g. [110210] meaning row 1st, colunm 1st, and likewise the dimension goes on, ..., index contains multiple of these [110210, 110220, ......]
The type can be text, media, or hidden
  Hidden is used for internal purpose only, and index is used to represent different types, index = 0 (for tag hierarchy)
  
id will be equal to initially created date
content of hierarchy is as e.g., text>text>text>text;pext>pext


content of normal will be like "hierarchy__5050__textcontent__5050__textcontent__5050__mediapath__5050__textcontent" // note: __5050__ is separation
type is in the form "test>text__5050__background_color,font__5050__text__5050__width,height,alignment__5050__text__5050__width,height,alignment__5050__media__5050__width,height,alignment__5050__text"

// note the first one is the tag hierarchy the note is present in , if blank then by default it is present in root, also after each of "text" or "media" , __5050__width,height,alignment__5050__ comes

type meaning hierarchy__5050__text__5050__.........., represents how the content is arranged
